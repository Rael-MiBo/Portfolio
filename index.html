          I'm a Brazilian guy, and I'm a student of Computer Science. I have a
          strong passion for technology, programming, and problem-solving. I'm
          always looking to improve my skills and stay up to date with the
          latest advancements in the tech world.
          <p>
            I enjoy working on projects that challenge me, whether it's
            developing software, or analyzing data. In my free time, I like to
            learn new programming languages, experiment with different
            frameworks, and contribute to open-source projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides coding, I also enjoy gaming, listening to music, and
            exploring new technologies that can make life easier and more
            efficient. My goal is to become a skilled software developer and
            work on innovative projects that can have a real impact on people's
            lives.

            I've studied several programming languages, including Python,
            JavaScript, C++, Java, PHP, and SQL. This diverse experience has
            given me a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end
            development, as well as database management.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy exploring different programming paradigms and understanding
            how each language can be used to solve specific problems
            efficiently. Python is my go-to for automation and data analysis,
            while JavaScript helps me build interactive web applications. C++
            has strengthened my understanding of performance optimization, and
            Java has provided me with solid object-oriented programming skills.
            PHP and SQL, on the other hand, have allowed me to work with dynamic
            websites and database-driven applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and experiment with new
            technologies to enhance my coding skills and stay up to date with
            industry trends.
